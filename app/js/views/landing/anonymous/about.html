                <p>In the UK, 13 million people are living in poverty, while 650,000 tonnes of perfectly good food is thrown away by food businesses. This is a crazy situation - but it doesn't have to be this way.</p>

                <p>We seek to inspire food businesses to give their surplus food to those who need it, so it will never ever go to waste.</p>

                <h2>Our history and co-founders</h2>
                <p>It started with a small group of London Citizens, voting for one project that would help us make a positive impact... Plan Zheroes won because it is a no-brainer!</p>
                <p>Then in 2011 London Leaders elected Lotti and Plan Zheroes as one of the 15 projects to make London a more sustainable city in 2011.</p>
                <p>The RSA Catalyst Fund was the best support to create our map, and then <a href="http://keytree.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Keytree</b></a> got involved and doing an amazing work in building our new platform and tools, all pro-bono.</p>
                <p>Today we are a young registered Charity (C.I.O.), and we have a great board driving the transition phase.</p>
                <p>In 2014, we have made great progress with the help from a core team of volunteers, funding from Garfield Weston, collaboration with Sustain/FoodSave and consultancy support from Cranfield Trust and Lloyds Bank Social Entrepreneurs Programme (Start-Up) with the School of Social Entrepreneurs.</p>
                <p>2015, here we are with a new interactive map! Launched on the 29th January, it was created by Keytree - our fantastic IT team. Our mission now is to populate it with hundreds of new Zheroes!</p>

                        <p>Lotti is our real foundation. Without Lotti we would not exist. An Austrian aristocrat now 90 years old and WWII refugee, she has experienced real hunger after the war so much that one day, Lotti had to trade her shoes to a get a loaf of bread from a farmer, in order to feed her little sister and herself. Her energy, clarity and determination are at the core of Plan Zheroes mission... as she gave us the vision of one day no one will be living in food poverty and no good food will be wasted! In 2011, the London Sustainable Development Commission elected Lotti and Plan Zheroes London Leaders. Her unstoppable contribution to our mission happens in various ways, sometimes inspiring the team or other infuential leaders, sometimes sending emails at 2:00am, other times attracting important people. She is for sure one of our best champions... as our volunteers put it, we have "lots of Lottie's power"!</p>

                        <p>Maria Ana is one of the 3 co-founders of Plan Zheroes. Maria Ana has brought 30 years of experience in innovation, design and entrepreneurship. Her real passion can be found in a mix of solving wicked problems, social innovation and design. She loves the early stages of shaping new ideas into projects and projects into brands and solutions to complex problems. She also lectures in strategic design and design thinking, and often involved in innovative initiatives like design jams or cutting edge projects or public speaking. She was a judge of the first The Grocer's Green-Awards in 2008! We think she was great at finding new ways to spread Plan Zheroes concept to take us closer to our mission. What she has added to the Zheroes team: resilience and creativity and design - her great strength has been in shaping our brand, building alliances and collaborating with others but perhaps her best quality is her genuine enthusiasm, flexibility and tremendous network of interesting people and ideas.</p>

                        <p>Chris is a brilliant coordinator and co-founder of Plan Zheroes, and someone everyone trusts and loves working with. One of his best skills is the ability to bring out the best of people, and that is pretty special! With about three years of taking top responsibility to develop Plan Zheroes, he is perhaps the only person in the planet that really mastered the art of Zheroes-linkage! He is completely passionate about social justice, so much that he took a chance to retire from 27 years at the BBC, included various posts such as indexer, flm researcher and member of the Senior Management Team in the Archive, to dedicate his life to social causes and coaching entrepreneurs! What we would never ever do as well, if Chris has not joined us: the ability to learn, listen and build trust. The great skill of being humble and open as well as the precision of a skillful organizer. He always acts with confdence and never ever has a panic attack (ok...sometimes we can see a little evidence of desperation, but we have to know him very well).</p>

Her experiences in property investment (since the age of 21) and in the management of chambers guided her to examine and implement ways that legal services could be provided in the future by focussing on direct public access to the talent and specialism of the Bar.Within three months of founding Cotswold Barristers, Carla oversaw the management and client care of over 250 clients in the biggest single direct access case in UK history. Carla's invaluable knowledge helps Plan Zheroes in a number of ways: she provides a legal perspective and a young managerial mindset. Carla has many more innovative ideas that will be implemented over the coming years. She attributes her inventiveness to her great-uncle who, amongst other things, developed a prototype catalytic converter in Mexico.</p>
