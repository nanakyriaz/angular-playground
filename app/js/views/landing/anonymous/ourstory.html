                <p>In the UK, 13 million people are living in poverty, while 650,000 tonnes of perfectly good food is thrown away by food businesses. This is a crazy situation - but it doesn't have to be this way.</p>

                <p>We seek to inspire food businesses to give their surplus food to those who need it, so it will never ever go to waste.</p>

                <h2 class="top-padding">Our values and principles</h2>

                <ul>

                <h2>Our history and co-founders</h2>
                <p>It started with a small group of London Citizens, voting for one project that would help us make a positive impact... Plan Zheroes won because it is a no-brainer!</p>
                <p>Then in 2011 London Leaders elected Lotti and Plan Zheroes as one of the 15 projects to make London a more sustainable city in 2011.</p>
                <p>The RSA Catalyst Fund was the best support to create our map, and then <a href="http://keytree.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Keytree</b></a> got involved and doing an amazing work in building our new platform and tools, all pro-bono.</p>
                <p>Today we are a young registered Charity (C.I.O.), and we have a great board driving the transition phase.</p>
                <p>In 2014, we have made great progress with the help from a core team of volunteers, funding from Garfield Weston, collaboration with Sustain/FoodSave and consultancy support from Cranfield Trust and Lloyds Bank Social Entrepreneurs Programme (Start-Up) with the School of Social Entrepreneurs.</p>
                <p>2015, here we are with a new interactive map! Launched on the 29th January, it was created by Keytree - our fantastic IT team. Our mission now is to populate it with hundreds of new Zheroes!</p>

                        <p>Lotti is our real foundation. Without Lotti we would not exist. An Austrian aristocrat now 90 years old and WWII refugee, she has experienced real hunger after the war so much that one day, Lotti had to trade her shoes to a get a loaf of bread from a farmer, in order to feed her little sister and herself. Her energy, clarity and determination are at the core of Plan Zheroes mission... as she gave us the vision of one day no one will be living in food poverty and no good food will be wasted! In 2011, the London Sustainable Development Commission elected Lotti and Plan Zheroes London Leaders. Her unstoppable contribution to our mission happens in various ways, sometimes inspiring the team or other infuential leaders, sometimes sending emails at 2:00am, other times attracting important people. She is for sure one of our best champions... as our volunteers put it, we have "lots of Lottie's power"!</p>

                        <div class="role">Co-Founder and most trusted connector</div>
                        <p>Chris is a brilliant coordinator and co-founder of Plan Zheroes, and someone everyone trusts and loves working with. One of his best skills is the ability to bring out the best of people, and that is pretty special! With about three years of taking top responsibility to develop Plan Zheroes, he is perhaps the only person in the planet that really mastered the art of Zheroes-linkage! He is completely passionate about social justice, so much that he took a chance to retire from 27 years at the BBC, included various posts such as indexer, flm researcher and member of the Senior Management Team in the Archive, to dedicate his life to social causes and coaching entrepreneurs! What we would never ever do as well, if Chris has not joined us: the ability to learn, listen and build trust. The great skill of being humble and open as well as the precision of a skillful organizer. He always acts with confdence and never ever has a panic attack (ok...sometimes we can see a little evidence of desperation, but we have to know him very well).</p>
